 * Instructions:
 * For this practice lab, you are going to write a program that estimates the
 * number of ingredients and the costs for "pizza friday" at MS 88, a large
 * public Middle School in Brooklyn, NY.
 *
 * Since school lunch is now free for all  students in New York City, you do not
 * need to consider any income, revenues, or profits. Some students, though,
 * choose to bring their own lunch.
 *
 * These instructions do not include all of the information that you need to
 * know, so you will need to use variables rather than  hardcoded literal values.
 * Organize your program into functions so that you can change the data without
 * changing the logic of your calculations.
 *
 * Let's assume that the school cooks make the pizzas semi-fresh -- they buy cans
 * of tomato sauce, frozen, dough, and shredded  cheese. To make a pizza, they
 * roll out the dough, cover the dough with sauce and cheese, and then fire up
 * the pizzas.
 *
 * For your estimates, you know that:
 * - 1 ball of dough makes 3 pizzas
 * - 1 can of sauce makes 5 pizzas
 * - 1 bag of cheese makes 6 pizzas
 *
 * Your program should estimate how many students eat lunch and then print out a
 * report of an estimate of costs and materials for a single day that includes:
 * - the quantity and total cost for pizza dough
 * - the quantity and total cost for cans of sauce
 * - the quantity and total cost for bags of cheese
 * - the number of students served (estimate)
 * - the total cost
 * - the cost per student
 *
 * Before you can solve this problem, you will have to do a little bit of
 * resaerch on your data. In the header comments for your program, please list
 * where your information came from. For more information about MS 88, you can
 * visit:
 * https://www.nycenet.edu/OA/SchoolReports/2016-17/School_Quality_Snapshot_2017_EMS_K088.pdf
 *
 * Your program must include a header comment with your name (and the other information
 * mentioned above). All of your code should be organized into functions. The only
 * statement outside of a function should be main(), which will start your program. You
 * do not need to ask the user for any data inputs with window.prompt -- include
 * all of the data you need as variables.
