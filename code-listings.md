Code templates, solutions, and examples
---------------------------------------

### Using repl.it


Online code examples in this book are hosted on <https://repl.it>. Called "repls",
these source files and programs can be edited and run online, and can be
easily **forked** (remixed) and shared. Several types of repls are available:
blank templates for working on practice exercises and labs, solutions to
exercise problems, and longer code listings that appear in the book.

We recommend that you make a free account on repl.it to fully work with the
examples, however, you can run and edit the programs as an anonymous user. You
cannot save your work without an account.
