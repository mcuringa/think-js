<h2>A very brief forward to the Javascript edition</h2>
<p>In the Ed Tech department at Adelphi, we have switched our introductory programming courses from Python to Javascript. Javascript has many of the features we like about Python, but also offers easy congiguration and a path to developing web and mobile apps without introducing additional programming languages. Most of the text is a straight port of the Python text, with some details to the specific Javascript features. The chapters are augmented with video tutorials and large code samples that focus on unstructured problem solving.</p>

<h2>Foreword to Learning with Python 3 (RLE)</h2>
<p>By David Beazley</p>
<p>As an educator, researcher, and book author, I am delighted to see the completion of this book. Python is a fun and extremely easy-to-use programming language that has steadily gained in popularity over the last few years. Developed over ten years ago by Guido van Rossum, Python’s simple syntax and overall feel is largely derived from ABC, a teaching language that was developed in the 1980’s. However, Python was also created to solve real problems and it borrows a wide variety of features from programming languages such as C++, Java, Modula-3, and Scheme. Because of this, one of Python’s most remarkable features is its broad appeal to professional software developers, scientists, researchers, artists, and educators.</p>
<p>Despite Python’s appeal to many different communities, you may still wonder why Python? or why teach programming with Python? Answering these questions is no simple task—especially when popular opinion is on the side of more masochistic alternatives such as C++ and Java. However, I think the most direct answer is that programming in Python is simply a lot of fun and more productive.</p>
<p>When I teach computer science courses, I want to cover important concepts in addition to making the material interesting and engaging to students. Unfortunately, there is a tendency for introductory programming courses to focus far too much attention on mathematical abstraction and for students to become frustrated with annoying problems related to low-level details of syntax, compilation, and the enforcement of seemingly arcane rules. Although such abstraction and formalism is important to professional software engineers and students who plan to continue their study of computer science, taking such an approach in an introductory course mostly succeeds in making computer science boring. When I teach a course, I don’t want to have a room of uninspired students. I would much rather see them trying to solve interesting problems by exploring different ideas, taking unconventional approaches, breaking the rules, and learning from their mistakes. In doing so, I don’t want to waste half of the semester trying to sort out obscure syntax problems, unintelligible compiler error messages, or the several hundred ways that a program might generate a general protection fault.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I like Python is that it provides a really nice balance between the practical and the conceptual. Since Python is interpreted, beginners can pick up the language and start doing neat things almost immediately without getting lost in the problems of compilation and linking. Furthermore, Python comes with a large library of modules that can be used to do all sorts of tasks ranging from web-programming to graphics. Having such a practical focus is a great way to engage students and it allows them to complete significant projects. However, Python can also serve as an excellent foundation for introducing important computer science concepts. Since Python fully supports procedures and classes, students can be gradually introduced to topics such as procedural abstraction, data structures, and object-oriented programming — all of which are applicable to later courses on Java or C++. Python even borrows a number of features from functional programming languages and can be used to introduce concepts that would be covered in more detail in courses on Scheme and Lisp.</p>
<p>In reading Jeffrey’s preface, I am struck by his comments that Python allowed him to see a higher level of success and a lower level of frustration and that he was able to move faster with better results. Although these comments refer to his introductory course, I sometimes use Python for these exact same reasons in advanced graduate level computer science courses at the University of Chicago. In these courses, I am constantly faced with the daunting task of covering a lot of difficult course material in a blistering nine week quarter. Although it is certainly possible for me to inflict a lot of pain and suffering by using a language like C++, I have often found this approach to be counterproductive—especially when the course is about a topic unrelated to just programming. I find that using Python allows me to better focus on the actual topic at hand while allowing students to complete substantial class projects.</p>
<p>Although Python is still a young and evolving language, I believe that it has a bright future in education. This book is an important step in that direction. David Beazley University of Chicago Author of the <em>Python Essential Reference</em></p>

<h2>Contributor List</h2>
<p>To paraphrase the philosophy of the Free Software Foundation, this book is free like free speech, but not necessarily free like free pizza. It came about because of a collaboration that would not have been possible without the GNU Free Documentation License. So we would like to thank the Free Software Foundation for developing this license and, of course, making it available to us.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank the more than 100 sharp-eyed and thoughtful readers who have sent us suggestions and corrections over the past few years. In the spirit of free software, we decided to express our gratitude in the form of a contributor list. Unfortunately, this list is not complete, but we are doing our best to keep it up to date. It was also getting too large to include everyone who sends in a typo or two. You have our gratitude, and you have the personal satisfaction of making a book you found useful better for you and everyone else who uses it. New additions to the list for the 2nd edition will be those who have made on-going contributions.</p>
<p>If you have a chance to look through the list, you should realize that each person here has spared you and all subsequent readers from the confusion of a technical error or a less-than-transparent explanation, just by sending us a note.</p>
<p>Impossible as it may seem after so many corrections, there may still be errors in this book. If you should stumble across one, we hope you will take a minute to contact us. The email address (for the Python 3 version of the book) is <a href="mailto:p.wentworth@ru.ac.za">p.wentworth@ru.ac.za</a>. Substantial changes made due to your suggestions will add you to the next version of the contributor list (unless you ask to be omitted). Thank you!</p>

<h2>Preface to previous edition</h2>
<p>By Jeffrey Elkner</p>
<p>This book owes its existence to the collaboration made possible by the Internet and the free software movement. Its three authors—a college professor, a high school teacher, and a professional programmer—never met face to face to work on it, but we have been able to collaborate closely, aided by many other folks who have taken the time and energy to send us their feedback.</p>
<p>We think this book is a testament to the benefits and future possibilities of this kind of collaboration, the framework for which has been put in place by Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<section id="how-and-why-i-came-to-use-python" class="level2">
<h2>How and why I came to use Python</h2>
<p>In 1999, the College Board’s Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science exam was given in C++ for the first time. As in many high schools throughout the country, the decision to change languages had a direct impact on the computer science curriculum at Yorktown High School in Arlington, Virginia, where I teach. Up to this point, Pascal was the language of instruction in both our first-year and AP courses. In keeping with past practice of giving students two years of exposure to the same language, we made the decision to switch to C++ in the first year course for the 1997-98 school year so that we would be in step with the College Board’s change for the AP course the following year.</p>
<p>Two years later, I was convinced that C++ was a poor choice to use for introducing students to computer science. While it is certainly a very powerful programming language, it is also an extremely difficult language to learn and teach. I found myself constantly fighting with C++’s difficult syntax and multiple ways of doing things, and I was losing many students unnecessarily as a result. Convinced there had to be a better language choice for our first-year class, I went looking for an alternative to C++.</p>
<p>I needed a language that would run on the machines in our GNU/Linux lab as well as on the Windows and Macintosh platforms most students have at home. I wanted it to be free software, so that students could use it at home regardless of their income. I wanted a language that was used by professional programmers, and one that had an active developer community around it. It had to support both procedural and object-oriented programming. And most importantly, it had to be easy to learn and teach. When I investigated the choices with these goals in mind, Python stood out as the best candidate for the job.</p>
<p>I asked one of Yorktown’s talented students, Matt Ahrens, to give Python a try. In two months he not only learned the language but wrote an application called pyTicket that enabled our staff to report technology problems via the Web. I knew that Matt could not have finished an application of that scale in so short a time in C++, and this accomplishment, combined with Matt’s positive assessment of Python, suggested that Python was the solution I was looking for.</p>
</section>
<section id="finding-a-textbook" class="level2">
<h2>Finding a textbook</h2>
<p>Having decided to use Python in both of my introductory computer science classes the following year, the most pressing problem was the lack of an available textbook.</p>
<p>Free documents came to the rescue. Earlier in the year, Richard Stallman had introduced me to Allen Downey. Both of us had written to Richard expressing an interest in developing free educational materials. Allen had already written a first-year computer science textbook, <em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em>. When I read this book, I knew immediately that I wanted to use it in my class. It was the clearest and most helpful computer science text I had seen. It emphasized the processes of thought involved in programming rather than the features of a particular language. Reading it immediately made me a better teacher.</p>
<p><em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em> was not just an excellent book, but it had been released under the GNU public license, which meant it could be used freely and modified to meet the needs of its user. Once I decided to use Python, it occurred to me that I could translate Allen’s original Java version of the book into the new language. While I would not have been able to write a textbook on my own, having Allen’s book to work from made it possible for me to do so, at the same time demonstrating that the cooperative development model used so well in software could also work for educational materials.</p>
<p>Working on this book for the last two years has been rewarding for both my students and me, and my students played a big part in the process. Since I could make instant changes whenever someone found a spelling error or difficult passage, I encouraged them to look for mistakes in the book by giving them a bonus point each time they made a suggestion that resulted in a change in the text. This had the double benefit of encouraging them to read the text more carefully and of getting the text thoroughly reviewed by its most important critics, students using it to learn computer science.</p>
<p>For the second half of the book on object-oriented programming, I knew that someone with more real programming experience than I had would be needed to do it right. The book sat in an unfinished state for the better part of a year until the open source community once again provided the needed means for its completion.</p>
<p>I received an email from Chris Meyers expressing interest in the book. Chris is a professional programmer who started teaching a programming course last year using Python at Lane Community College in Eugene, Oregon. The prospect of teaching the course had led Chris to the book, and he started helping out with it immediately. By the end of the school year he had created a companion project on our Website at <a href="http://openbookproject.net" class="uri">http://openbookproject.net</a> (<em>Python for Fun</em>)[http://openbookproject.net/py4fun&gt;] and was working with some of my most advanced students as a master teacher, guiding them beyond where I could take them.</p>
</section>
<section id="introducing-programming-with-python" class="level2">
<h2>Introducing programming with Python</h2>
<p>The process of translating and using <em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em> for the past two years has confirmed Python’s suitability for teaching beginning students. Python greatly simplifies programming examples and makes important programming ideas easier to teach.</p>
<p>The first example from the text illustrates this point. It is the traditional hello, world program, which in the Java version of the book looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">class</span> Hello</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" data-line-number="2">{</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" data-line-number="3">    <span class="kw">public</span> <span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">void</span> <span class="fu">main</span> (<span class="bu">String</span>[] args)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" data-line-number="4">    {</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-5" data-line-number="5">        <span class="bu">System</span>.<span class="fu">out</span>.<span class="fu">println</span> (<span class="st">&quot;Hello, world.&quot;</span>);</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-6" data-line-number="6">    }</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-7" data-line-number="7">}</a></code></pre></div>
<p>in the Python version it becomes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Even though this is a trivial example, the advantages of Python stand out. Yorktown’s Computer Science I course has no prerequisites, so many of the students seeing this example are looking at their first program. Some of them are undoubtedly a little nervous, having heard that computer programming is difficult to learn. The Java version has always forced me to choose between two unsatisfying options: either to explain the <code>class Hello</code>, <code>public static void main</code>, <code>String[] args</code>, <code>{</code>, and <code>}</code>, statements and risk confusing or intimidating some of the students right at the start, or to tell them, Just don’t worry about all of that stuff now; we will talk about it later, and risk the same thing. The educational objectives at this point in the course are to introduce students to the idea of a programming statement and to get them to write their first program, thereby introducing them to the programming environment. The Python program has exactly what is needed to do these things, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Comparing the explanatory text of the program in each version of the book further illustrates what this means to the beginning student. There are seven paragraphs of explanation of Hello, world! in the Java version; in the Python version, there are only a few sentences. More importantly, the missing six paragraphs do not deal with the big ideas in computer programming but with the minutia of Java syntax. I found this same thing happening throughout the book. Whole paragraphs simply disappear from the Python version of the text because Python’s much clearer syntax renders them unnecessary.</p>
<p>Using a very high-level language like Python allows a teacher to postpone talking about low-level details of the machine until students have the background that they need to better make sense of the details. It thus creates the ability to put first things first pedagogically. One of the best examples of this is the way in which Python handles variables. In Java a variable is a name for a place that holds a value if it is a built-in type, and a reference to an object if it is not. Explaining this distinction requires a discussion of how the computer stores data. Thus, the idea of a variable is bound up with the hardware of the machine. The powerful and fundamental concept of a variable is already difficult enough for beginning students (in both computer science and algebra). Bytes and addresses do not help the matter. In Python a variable is a name that refers to a thing. This is a far more intuitive concept for beginning students and is much closer to the meaning of variable that they learned in their math courses. I had much less difficulty teaching variables this year than I did in the past, and I spent less time helping students with problems using them.</p>
<p>Another example of how Python aids in the teaching and learning of programming is in its syntax for functions. My students have always had a great deal of difficulty understanding functions. The main problem centers around the difference between a function definition and a function call, and the related distinction between a parameter and an argument. Python comes to the rescue with syntax that is nothing short of beautiful. Function definitions begin with the keyword <code>def</code>, so I simply tell my students, When you define a function, begin with <code>def</code>, followed by the name of the function that you are defining; when you call a function, simply call (type) out its name. Parameters go with definitions; arguments go with calls. There are no return types, parameter types, or reference and value parameters to get in the way, so I am now able to teach functions in less than half the time that it previously took me, with better comprehension.</p>
<p>Using Python improved the effectiveness of our computer science program for all students. I saw a higher general level of success and a lower level of frustration than I experienced teaching with either C++ or Java. I moved faster with better results. More students left the course with the ability to create meaningful programs and with the positive attitude toward the experience of programming that this engenders.</p>

<h2>The Rhodes Local Edition (RLE) (Version of August, 2012)</h2>
<p>By Peter Wentworth</p>
<aside>
<p><strong>A word of thanks …</strong></p>
<p>We switched from Java to Python in our introductory courses in 2010. So far we think the results look positive. More time will tell.</p>
<p>This predecessor to this book was a great starting point for us, especially because of the liberal permission to change things. Having our own in-house course notes or handouts allows us to adapt and stay fresh, rearrange, see what works, and it gives us agility. We can also ensure that every student in the course gets a copy of the handouts — something that doesn’t always happen if we prescribe costly textbooks.</p>
Many thanks to all the contributors and the authors for making their hard work available to the Python community and to our students.
</aside>
<p>A colleague and friend, Peter Warren, once made the remark that learning introductory programming is as much about the environment as it is about the programming language.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).<br />
I want help to be integrated into my editor, as a first-class citizen, available at the press of a button. I want syntax highlighting. I want immediate syntax checking, and sensible autocompletion. I’d like an editor that can fold function bodies or regions of code away, because it promotes and encourages how we build mental abstractions.</p>
<p>I’m especially keen on having a single-stepping debugger and breakpoints with code inspection built in. We’re trying to build a conceptual model of program execution in the student’s mind, so I find most helpful for teaching to have the call stack and variables explicitly visible, and to be able to immediately inspect the result of executing a statement.</p>
<p>My philosophy, then, is not to look for a language to teach, but to look for a combination of IDE and language that are packaged together, and evaluated as a whole.</p>
<p>I’ve made some quite deep changes to the original book to reflect this (and various other opinionated views that I hold), and I have no doubt that more changes will follow as we mature our course.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key things I’ve approached differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our local situation demands that we have a large number of service course students in an introductory course of just 3 weeks, and then we get another semester of teaching with those going into our mainstream program. So the book is in two parts: we’ll do the first five chapters in the big “get your toes wet” course, and the rest of the material in a separate semester.</li>
<li>We’re using Python 3. It is cleaner, more object oriented, and has fewer ad-hoc irregularities than earlier versions of Python.</li>
<li>We’re using PyScripter as our IDE, on Windows. And it is hardwired into parts of these notes, with screenshots, etc.</li>
<li>I’ve dropped GASP.</li>
<li>For graphics we start with the Turtle module.<br />
As things move along, we use PyGame for more advanced graphics.</li>
<li>I’ve introduced some event-driven programming using the turtle.<br />
</li>
<li>I have tried to push more object-oriented notions earlier, without asking students to synthesize objects or write their own classes. So, for example, in the chapter about the turtle, we create multiple instances of turtles, talk about their attributes and state (color, position, etc), and we favour method-call style to move them around, i.e. <code>tess.forward(100)</code>. Similarly, when we use random numbers, we avoid the “hidden singleton generator” in the random module — we prefer to create an instance of a generator, and invoke methods on the instance.</li>
<li>The ease of constructing lists and the <code>for</code> loop seem to be winners in Python, so rather than use the traditional command-line <code>input</code> for data, I’ve favoured using loops and lists right up front, like this:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python numberLines"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1">friends <span class="op">=</span> [<span class="st">&quot;Zoe&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Joe&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Bill&quot;</span>]</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="cf">for</span> f <span class="kw">in</span> friends:</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" data-line-number="3">    invitation <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;Hi &quot;</span> <span class="op">+</span> f <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot;.  Please come to my party on Saturday!&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" data-line-number="4">    <span class="bu">print</span>(invitation)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This also means that I bumped <code>range</code> up for early exposure.<br />
I envisage that over time we’ll see more opportunities to exploit “early lists, early iteration” in its most simple form.</p>
<ul>
<li>I dumped <code>doctest</code>: it is too quirky for my liking. For example, it fails a test if the spacing between list elements is not precisely the same as the output string, or if Python prints a string with single quotes, but you wrote up the test case with double quotes. Cases like this also confused students (and instructors) quite badly:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python numberLines"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">def</span> addlist(xs):</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-3" data-line-number="3">    <span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="co">    &gt;&gt;&gt; xs = [2,3,4]</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="co">    &gt;&gt;&gt; addlist(xs)</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="co">    9</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-7" data-line-number="7"><span class="co">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-8" data-line-number="8">    <span class="cf">return</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If you can explain the difference in scope rules and lifetimes between the parameter <code>xs</code> and the doctest variable <code>xs</code> elegantly, please let me know. Yes, I know doctest creates its own scope behind our back, but it is exactly this black magic that we’re trying to avoid.<br />
From the usual indentation rules, also looks like the doctests are nested inside the function scope, but they are not. Students thought that the parameter had been given its value by the assignment to <code>xs</code> in the doctest!</p>
<p>I also think that keeping the test suite separate from the functions under test leads to a cleaner relationship between caller and callee, and gives a better chance of getting argument passing / parameter concepts taught accurately.</p>
<p>There is a good unit testing module in Python, (and PyScripter offers integrated support for it, and automated generation of skeleton test modules), but it looked too advanced for beginners, because it requires multi-module concepts.</p>
<p>So I’ve favoured my own test scaffolding in Chapter 6 (about 10 lines of code) that the students must insert into whatever file they’re working on.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I’ve played down command-line input / process / output where possible. Many of our students have never seen a command-line shell, and it is arguably quite intimidating.</p></li>
<li><p>We’ve gone back to a more “classic / static” approach to writing our own classes and objects. Python (in company with languages like Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, etc.) don’t really emphasize notions of “sealed” classes or “private” members, or even “sealed instances”.</p>
<p>So one teaching approach is to allocate each instance as an empty container, and subsequently allow the external clients of the class to poke new members (methods or attributes) into different instances as they wish to.<br />
It is a very dynamic approach, but perhaps not one that encourages thinking in abstractions, layers, contracts, decoupling, etc. It might even be the kind of thing that one could write one of those <em>“x,y,z … considered harmful”</em> papers about.</p>
<p>In our more conservative approach, we put an initializer into every class, we determine at object instantiation time what members we want, and we initialize the instances from within the class. So we’ve moved closer in philosophy to C# / Java on this one.</p></li>
<li><p>We’re moving towards introducing more algorithms earlier into the course. Python is an efficient teaching language — we can make fast progress. But the gains we make there we’d like to invest into deeper problem solving, and more complex algorithms with the basics, rather than cover “more Python features”. Some of these changes have started to find their way in this version, and I’m sure we’ll see more in future.</p></li>
<li><p>We’re interested in issues around teaching and learning. Some research indicates that “intellectual playfulness” is important. The study referenced in the Odds-and-ends workbook at the end just didn’t seem to have anywhere sensible to go in the book, yet I wanted it included. It is quite likely that we’ll allow more issues like this to creep into the book, to try to make it more than just about programming in Python.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="the-way-of-the-program" class="level1">
<h1>The way of the program</h1>
<p>The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.</p>
<p>The single most important skill for a computer scientist is <strong>problem solving</strong>. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That’s why this chapter is called, The way of the program.</p>
<p>On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.</p>
<section id="the-javascript-programming-language" class="level2">
<h2>The Javascript programming language</h2>
<p>The programming language you will be learning is Javascript. Javascript is an example of a <strong>high-level language</strong>; other high-level languages you might have heard of are Python, C++, PHP, Pascal, C#, and Java. It’s important to point out that Java and Javascript are two different programming languages with different syntax, styles, purposes, and histories. They unfortunately, share a very close name!</p>
<p>As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also <strong>low-level languages</strong>, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages. Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be translated into something more suitable before they can run.</p>
<p>Almost all programs are written in high-level languages because of their advantages. It is much easier to program in a high-level language so programs take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are <strong>portable</strong>, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications.</p>
<p>The engine that translates and runs Javascript is called the <strong>Javascript Interpreter</strong>. All modern web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, MS Edge/IE, etc) ship with a Javascript interpreter. You can also install a stand-alone interpreter on your computer.</p>
<p>The longer code examples in this book will use <a href="https://repl.it">Repl.it</a>, an online programming platform and community. Code listings include links to the “repl” that you can copy (“fork”) and experiment with.</p>
<p>There are two ways to use the interpreter: <em>interactive or immediate mode</em> and <em>script mode</em>. In immediate mode, you type Javascript expressions into the interpreter’s console, and the interpreter immediately shows the result. This is the an example of the repl.it interpreter’s console:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="ex">Babel</span> Compiler v6.4.4</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="ex">Copyright</span> (c) <span class="ex">2014-2015</span> Sebastian McKenzie</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-3" data-line-number="3">   </a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-4" data-line-number="4">⠕ <span class="ex">2+2</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-5" data-line-number="5">=<span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="ex">4</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>2+2</code> is entered at the <strong>Javascript prompt</strong>. The <code>⠕</code> token indicates a statement entered at the prompt. The interpreter uses the prompt to indicate that it is ready for instructions. We typed <code>2 + 2</code> and hit <code>enter</code> the interpreter evaluated our expression, and replied <code>4</code>, and on the next line it gave a new prompt. In this case, <code>4</code> is the <strong>output</strong> and it is indicated as output in our console by the <code>=&gt;</code> token.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can write a program in a file and use the interpreter to execute the contents of the file. Such a file is called a <strong>script</strong>. Scripts have the advantage that they can be saved to disk, printed, shared, and so on.</p>
<p>For example, we created a file named <code>main.js</code> using our text editor. By convention, files that contain Javascript programs have names that end with <code>.js</code>, but they are just plain-text files.</p>
<p>To execute the program in repl.it, we simply click the “run” button. The output is shown in the console.</p>
<p>Working directly in the interpreter is convenient for testing short bits of code because you get immediate feedback. Think of it as scratch paper used to help you work out problems. Anything longer than a few lines should be put into a script.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-a-program" class="level2">
<h2>What is a program?</h2>
<p>A <strong>program</strong> is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.</p>
<p>The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:</p>
<dl>
<dt>input</dt>
<dd><p>Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.</p>
</dd>
<dt>output</dt>
<dd><p>Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look more or less like these. Thus, we can describe programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with sequences of these basic instructions.</p>
<p>That may be a little vague, but we will come back to this topic later when we talk about <strong>algorithms</strong>.</p>

<section id="what-is-debugging" class="level2">
<h2>What is debugging?</h2>
<p>Programming is a complex process, and because it is done by human beings, it often leads to errors. Programming errors are called <strong>bugs</strong> and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called <strong>debugging</strong>. Use of the term <em>bug</em> to describe small engineering difficulties dates back to at least 1889, when Thomas Edison had a bug with his phonograph.</p>
<p>Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error">syntax errors</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error">runtime errors</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error">semantic errors</a>. It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.</p>
</section>
<section id="syntax-errors" class="level2">
<h2>Syntax errors</h2>
<p>Javascript can only execute a program if the program is syntactically correct; otherwise, the process fails and returns an error message. <strong>Syntax</strong> refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example, in English, a sentence must begin with a capital letter and end with a period. this sentence contains a <strong>syntax error</strong>. So does this one</p>
<p>For most readers, a few syntax errors are not a significant problem, which is why we can read the poetry of E. E. Cummings without (too many) problems. Javascript is not so forgiving. If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your program, Javascript will display an error message and quit, and you will not be able to run your program. During the first few weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain experience, though, you will make fewer errors and find them faster.</p>
</section>
<section id="runtime-errors" class="level2">
<h2>Runtime errors</h2>
<p>The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until you run the program. These errors are also called <strong>exceptions</strong> because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.</p>
<p>Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one.</p>
</section>
<section id="semantic-errors" class="level2">
<h2>Semantic errors</h2>
<p>The third type of error is the <strong>semantic error</strong>. If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run successfully, in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it will do what you told it to do.</p>
<p>The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you wanted to write. The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong. Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing.</p>
</section>
<section id="experimental-debugging" class="level2">
<h2>Experimental debugging</h2>
<p>One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts of programming.</p>
<p>In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues, and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see.</p>
<p>Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, then you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes pointed out, When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. (A. Conan Doyle, <em>The Sign of Four</em>)</p>
<p>For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a program that does <em>something</em> and make small modifications, debugging them as you go, so that you always have a working program.</p>
<p>For example, Linux is an operating system kernel that contains millions of lines of code, but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386 chip. According to Larry Greenfield, one of Linus’s earlier projects was a program that would switch between displaying AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved to Linux (<em>The Linux Users’ Guide</em> Beta Version 1).</p>
<p>Later chapters will make more suggestions about debugging and other programming practices.</p>
</section>
<section id="formal-and-natural-languages" class="level2">
<h2>Formal and natural languages</h2>
<p><strong>Natural languages</strong> are the languages that people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Formal languages</strong> are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax. For example, <code>3+3=6</code> is a syntactically correct mathematical statement, but <code>3=+6$</code> is not. H<sub>2</sub>O is a syntactically correct chemical name, but <sub>2</sub>Zz is not.</p>
<p>Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to <strong>tokens</strong> and structure. Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, parentheses, commas, and so on. In Javascript, a statement like <code>console.log(&quot;Happy New Year for &quot;, 2013)</code> has 6 tokens: a function name, an open parenthesis (round bracket), a string, a comma, a number, and a close parenthesis.</p>
<p>It is possible to make errors in the way one constructs tokens.<br />
One of the problems with <code>3=+6$</code> is that <code>$</code> is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as we know). Similarly, <sub>2</sub>Zz is not a legal token in chemistry notation because there is no element with the abbreviation <code>Zz</code>.</p>
<p>The second type of syntax rule pertains to the <strong>structure</strong> of a statement—that is, the way the tokens are arranged. The statement <code>3=+6$</code> is structurally illegal because you can’t place a plus sign immediately after an equal sign. Similarly, molecular formulas have to have subscripts <em>after</em> the element name, not before. And in our Javascript example, if we omitted the comma, or if we changed the two parentheses around to say <code>console.log)&quot;Happy New Year for &quot;,2013(</code> our statement would still have six legal and valid tokens, but the structure is illegal.</p>
<p>When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called <strong>parsing</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, when you hear the sentence, “The other shoe fell”, you understand that the other shoe is the subject and fell is the verb. Once you have parsed a sentence, you can figure out what it means, or the <strong>semantics</strong> of the sentence. Assuming that you know what a shoe is and what it means to fall, you will understand the general implication of this sentence.</p>
<p>Although formal and natural languages have many features in common—tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics—there are many differences:</p>
</section>
<section id="glossary" class="level2">
<h2>Glossary</h2>
<dl>
<dt>ambiguity</dt>
<dd><p>Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.</p>
</dd>
<dt>redundancy</dt>
<dd><p>In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>literalness</dt>
<dd><p>Formal languages mean exactly what they say. On the other hand, natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If someone says, “The other shoe fell”, there is probably no shoe and nothing falling.<br />
You’ll need to find the original joke to understand the idiomatic meaning of the other shoe falling. <em>Yahoo! Answers</em> thinks it knows!</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>People who grow up speaking a natural language—everyone—often have a hard time adjusting to formal languages. In some ways, the difference between formal and natural language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so:</p>
<dl>
<dt>poetry</dt>
<dd><p>Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>prose</dt>
<dd><p>The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.</p>
</dd>
<dt>program</dt>
<dd><p>The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal languages). First, remember that formal languages are much more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is very important, so it is usually not a good idea to read from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details matter. Little things like spelling errors and bad punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-first-program" class="level2">
<h2>The first program</h2>
<p>Traditionally, the first program written in a new language is called <em>Hello, World!</em> because all it does is display the words, Hello, World! In Javascript, the script looks like this: (For scripts, we’ll show line numbers to the left of the Javascript statements.)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This is an example of using <code>console.log</code>, Javascript’s <strong>print function</strong>, which doesn’t actually print anything on paper. It displays a value on the screen’s console. In this case, the result shown is</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="ex">Hello</span>, World!</a></code></pre></div>
<p>The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the value; they don’t appear in the result.</p>
<p>Some people judge the quality of a programming language by the simplicity of the Hello, World! program. By this standard, Javascript does about as well as possible.</p>
</section>
<section id="comments" class="level2">
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is doing.</p>
<p>A <strong>comment</strong> in a computer program is text that is intended only for the human reader — it is completely ignored by the interpreter.</p>
<p>In Javascript, the <code>\\</code> token starts a comment. The rest of the line is ignored. Here is a new version of <em>Hello, World!</em>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="co">//---------------------------------------------------</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-8" data-line-number="8">      </a></code></pre></div>
<p>You’ll also notice that we’ve left a blank line in the program. Blank lines are also ignored by the interpreter, but comments and blank lines can make your programs much easier for humans to parse. Use them liberally!</p>
<p>Javascript also supports multiline comments with the <code>/* */</code> style.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="co">/*</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-10" data-line-number="10">      </a></code></pre></div>
<p>In addition to adding hints and suggestions for human readers, comments play an important role in debugging. Because the Javascript interpreter doesn’t try to run commented lines, you can “comment out” sections of your code to isolate errors.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">// console.log(&quot;I am trying to find&quot;);</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="co">// console.log(&quot;out which line&quot;);</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="co">// console.log(&quot;of my code isn&#39;t&quot;);</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="co">// console.log(&quot;working the way I expect it to.);</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above code, only line 1 is interpreted and run as Javascript. The other lines are ignored. To debug this program, we can uncomment one line at a time until we find out which line has the buggy code.</p>
<p>It is so common for programmers to comment out large blocks of code when they are testing their programs, that programmer’s text editors support quickly commenting out sections of code. In repl.it, our online editor for this book, you can simply highlight the lines you want to comment or uncomment and use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> keyboard shortcut. You will see us using this technique in our example videos.</p>

<h1>Variables, expressions and statements</h1>
<section id="values-and-data-types" class="level2">
<h2>Values and data types</h2>
<p>A <strong>value</strong> is one of the fundamental things — like a letter or a number — that a program manipulates. Programming <code>turtle</code> we have been using values like <code>100</code> when we write <code>fd(100)</code> and <code>&quot;blue&quot;</code> in statements like <code>setColor(&quot;blue&quot;)</code>.</p>
<p>These values are classified into different <strong>classes</strong>, or <strong>data types</strong>: <code>100</code> is an <em>number</em>, and <code>&quot;blue&quot;</code> is a <em>string</em>, so-called because it contains a string of letters. You (and the interpreter) can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
<p>If you are not sure what class a value falls into, the Javascript <strong>typeof</strong> operator can tell you.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="kw">typeof</span> <span class="st">&quot;blue&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>

<p>Not surprisingly, strings are of type <code>string</code> and integers are of type <code>number</code>. In Javascript, both whole numbers and fractions (numbers with decimal points) are of type <code>number</code>. At this stage, you can treat the words <em>class</em> and <em>type</em> interchangeably. We’ll come back to a deeper understanding of what a class is in later chapters.</p>

<p>Double quoted strings can contain single quotes inside them, as in <code>&quot;Bruce's beard&quot;</code>, and single quoted strings can have double quotes inside them, as in <code>'The knights who say &quot;Ni!&quot;'</code>.</p>
<p>Strings enclosed with the backtick symbol are called <strong>template literals</strong>. Template literals can contain either single or double quotes:</p>

<p>Strings can also be joined use the <code>+</code> token which adds strings together (also called concatenation).</p>

<p>Javascript doesn’t care whether you use single or double quotes to surround your strings: once it has parsed the text of your program or command, the way it stores the value is identical in all cases, and the surrounding quotes are not part of the value. But when the interpreter wants to display a string, it has to decide which quotes to use to make it look like a string. It usually choose a single quote.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-1" data-line-number="1"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-2" data-line-number="2">⠕ <span class="st">&#39;This is a string.&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="st">&#39;This is a string.&#39;</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-7" data-line-number="7"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="st">&#39;This is a string too!&#39;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The code examples in this book will use double quotes as the default, and use single quotes and template literals when they make more sense (such as in strings containing double quotes or spanning multiple lines). We will learn more about template strings in the chapter on strings.</p>
<p>When you type a large number, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of three digits, as in <code>42,000</code>. This is not a legal number in Javascript, and different Javascript interpreters handle it differently. Formal languages are strict, the notation is concise, and even the smallest change might mean something quite different from what you intended.</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate <strong>variables</strong>. A variable is a name that refers to a value.</p>
<p>The <strong>let</strong> keyword declares a new variable and the <strong>assignment token</strong>, gives a value to a variable:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb19-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> message <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;What&#39;s up, Doc?&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb19-2" data-line-number="2">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> n <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">17</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb19-3" data-line-number="3">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> pi <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">3.14159</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This example declares three variables and assigns them values. The first assigns the string value <code>&quot;What's up, Doc?&quot;</code> to a variable named <code>message</code>. The second gives the number <code>17</code> to <code>n</code>, and the third assigns the number <code>3.14159</code> to a variable called <code>pi</code>.</p>
<p>The <strong>assignment token</strong>, <code>=</code>, should not be confused with <em>equals</em>, which uses the token <code>===</code>. The assignment statement binds a <em>name</em>, on the left-hand side of the operator, to a <em>value</em>, on the right-hand side. This is why you will get an error if you enter:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-1" data-line-number="1">        </a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-2" data-line-number="2">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> <span class="dv">17</span> <span class="op">=</span> n<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-3" data-line-number="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-4" data-line-number="4">SyntaxError<span class="op">:</span> unexpected token<span class="op">:</span> numeric literal</a></code></pre></div>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong> When reading or writing code, say to yourself “n is assigned 17” or “n gets the value 17”. Don’t say “n equals 17”.</em></p>
<p>A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing to the variable’s value. This kind of figure is called a <strong>state snapshot</strong> because it shows what state each of the variables is in at a particular instant in time. (Think of it as the variable’s state of mind). This diagram shows the result of executing the assignment statements:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/state.png" alt="State snapshot" /><figcaption>State snapshot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you ask the interpreter to evaluate a variable, it will produce the value that is currently linked to the variable:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ message</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="st">&#39;What&#39;</span>s up<span class="op">,</span> Doc<span class="op">?</span><span class="st">&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-3" data-line-number="3">⠕ n</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="dv">17</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-5" data-line-number="5">⠕ pi</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="fl">3.14159</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>We use variables in a program to “remember” things, perhaps the current score in the video game. But variables are <em>variable</em>. This means they can change over time, just like the score in a video game. You can assign a value to a variable, and later assign a different value to the same variable.<br />
(<em>This is different from maths. In maths, if you give <code>x</code> the value 3, it cannot change to link to a different value half-way through your calculations!</em>)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> day <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;Thursday&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-2" data-line-number="2">⠕ day</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="st">&#39;Thursday&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-4" data-line-number="4">⠕ day <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;Friday&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-5" data-line-number="5">⠕ day</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="st">&#39;Friday&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-7" data-line-number="7">⠕ day <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">21</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-8" data-line-number="8">⠕ day</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-9" data-line-number="9"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="dv">21</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You’ll notice we changed the value of <code>day</code> three times, and on the third assignment we even made it refer to a value that was of a different type.</p>
<p>A great deal of programming is about having the computer remember things, e.g. <em>The number of missed calls on your phone</em>, and then arranging to update or change the variable when you miss another call.</p>
</section>
<section id="variable-names-and-keywords" class="level2">
<h2>Variable names and keywords</h2>
<p><strong>Variable names</strong> and other <strong>identifiers</strong> can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and digits, but they have to begin with a letter, the dollar sign <code>$</code>, or an underscore <code>_</code>. Remember that case matters. <code>Bruce</code> and <code>bruce</code> are different variables.</p>
<p>In Javascript, capital letters are often used in variables tha contain multiple words, such as <code>myName</code> or <code>thePriceOfTeaInChina</code>. The underscore character (<code>_</code>) can appear in a name, too. You may see it to separate multiple words, such as <code>my_name</code> or <code>price_of_tea_in_china</code>, but this style is less common in Javascript.</p>
<p>Sometimes programmers start variables with underscores or dollar signs to give them special meanings. In this book, all variable names will start with letters.</p>
<p>If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb23-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> 76trombones <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;big parade&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb23-2" data-line-number="2">unknown<span class="op">:</span> Identifier directly after number</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb23-4" data-line-number="4">unknown<span class="op">:</span> Unexpected token </a></code></pre></div>
<p><code>76trombones</code> is illegal because it does not begin with a letter, but what’s wrong with <code>typeof</code>?</p>
<p>It turns out that <code>typeof</code> is reserved as one of Javascript’s <strong>keywords</strong>. Keywords define the language’s syntax rules and structure, and they cannot be used as variable names.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords">Javascript has almost fourty keywords</a> (different versions of Javascript have slightly different keywords):</p>

<p>You might want to keep this list handy. If the interpreter complains about one of your variable names and you don’t know why, see if it is on this list.</p>
<p>Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful to the human readers of the program—they help the programmer document, or remember, what the variable is used for.</p>
<aside id="meaningful-names">
<p>Beginners sometimes confuse “meaningful to the human readers” with “meaningful to the computer”. So they’ll wrongly think that because they’ve called some variable <code>average</code> or <code>pi</code>, it will somehow magically calculate an average, or magically know that the variable <code>pi</code> should have a value like 3.14159. No! The computer doesn’t understand what you intend the variable to mean.</p>
So you’ll find some instructors who deliberately don’t choose meaningful names when they teach beginners — not because we don’t think it is a good habit, but because we’re trying to reinforce the message that you — the programmer — must write the program code to calculate the average, and you must write an assignment statement to give the variable <code>pi</code> the value you want it to have.

<section id="statements" class="level2">
<h2>Statements</h2>
<p>A <strong>statement</strong> is an instruction that the Javascript interpreter can execute. We have mostly seen the assignment statement so far. Some other kinds of statements that we’ll see shortly are <code>while</code> statements, <code>for</code> statements, and <code>if</code> statements. (There are other kinds too!)</p>
<p>When you type a statement in the console and hit enter, Javascript executes it. Statements don’t produce any result.</p>
</section>
<section id="evaluating-expressions" class="level2">
<h2>Evaluating expressions</h2>
<p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. If you type an expression at the Javascript prompt, the interpreter <strong>evaluates</strong> it and displays the result:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb25-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="dv">1</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb25-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="dv">2</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb25-3" data-line-number="3">⠕ <span class="kw">typeof</span> <span class="st">&quot;hello&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb25-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="st">&#39;string&#39;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>In this example <code>typeof</code> is a Javascript operator that returns the type of a variable or literal data operand.</p>
<p>The <em>evaluation of an expression</em> produces a value, which is why expressions can appear on the right hand side of assignment statements. A value all by itself is a simple expression, and so is a variable.</p>
<p>These examples show the expression and the value they return indicated by <code>=&gt;</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb26"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb26-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="dv">17</span></a>

</section>
<section id="operators-and-operands" class="level2">
<h2>Operators and operands</h2>
<p><strong>Operators</strong> are special tokens that represent computations like addition, multiplication and division. The values the operator uses are called <strong>operands</strong>.</p>
<p>The following are all legal Javascript expressions whose meaning is more or less clear:</p>
<pre><code>20+32   hour-1   hour*60+minute   minute/60   5**2   (5+9)*(15-7)</code></pre>
<p>The tokens <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, and <code>*</code>, and the use of parenthesis for grouping, mean in Javascript what they mean in mathematics. The asterisk (<code>*</code>) is the token for multiplication, and <code>**</code> is the token for exponentiation.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb28-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="dv">2</span> <span class="op">**</span> <span class="dv">3</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb28-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="dv">8</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb28-3" data-line-number="3">⠕ <span class="dv">3</span> <span class="op">**</span> <span class="dv">2</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb28-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="dv">9</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>When a variable name appears in the place of an operand, it is replaced with its value before the operation is performed.</p>
<p>Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation all do what you expect.</p>
<p>Example: so let us convert 645 minutes into hours:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb29"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb29-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> minutes <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">645</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb29-2" data-line-number="2">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> hours <span class="op">=</span> minutes / <span class="dv">60</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb29-3" data-line-number="3">⠕ hours<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb29-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="fl">10.75</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Oops! In Javascript, the division operator <code>/</code> always yields a floating point (decimal) result. What we might have wanted to know was how many <em>whole</em> hours there are, and how many minutes remain. Javascript provides helpful <strong>Math</strong> functions to allow us to do this. <code>Math.floor()</code> rounds a number down to the nearest whole number. Its result is always a whole number — and if it has to adjust the number it always moves it to the left on the number line. So <code>Math.floor(6 / 4)</code> yields <code>1</code>, but <code>Math.floor(-6 / 4)</code> might surprise you!</p>

<h2>Type conversion</h2>
<p>Here we’ll look at some ways to convert data. We call these <strong>type converters</strong>.</p>
<p>The <code>Number.parseInt(arg)</code> function can take a floating point number or a string, and turn it into an whole number. For floating point numbers, it <em>discards</em> the decimal portion of the number — a process we call <em>truncation towards zero</em> on the number line. Let us see this in action:</p>

<section id="order-of-operations" class="level2">
<h2>Order of operations</h2>
<p>When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation depends on the <strong>rules of precedence</strong>. Javascript follows the same precedence rules for its mathematical operators that mathematics does. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember the order of operations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>P</strong> arentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, <code>2 * (3-1)</code> is 4, and <code>(1+1)**(5-2)</code> is
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in <code>(minute * 100) / 60</code>, even though it doesn’t change the result.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>E</strong> xponentiation has the next highest precedence, so <code>2**1+1</code> is 3 and not 4, and <code>3*1**3</code> is 3 and not 27.</li>
<li><strong>M</strong> ultiplication and both <strong>D</strong> ivision operators have the same precedence, which is higher than <strong>A</strong> ddition and <strong>S</strong> ubtraction, which also have the same precedence. So <code>2*3-1</code> yields 5 rather than 4, and <code>5-2*2</code> is 1, not 6.</li>
<li><p>Operators with the <em>same</em> precedence are evaluated from left-to-right. In algebra we say they are <em>left-associative</em>. So in the expression <code>6-3+2</code>, the subtraction happens first, yielding 3. We then add 2 to get the result 5. If the operations had been evaluated from right to left, the result would have been <code>6-(3+2)</code>, which is 1. (The acronym PEDMAS could mislead you to thinking that division has higher precedence than multiplication, and addition is done ahead of subtraction - don’t be misled.<br />
Subtraction and addition are at the same precedence, and the left-to-right rule applies.)</p>
<ul>
<li>An exception to the left-to-right left-associative rule is the exponentiation operator <code>**</code>, so a useful hint is to always use parentheses to force exactly the order you want when exponentiation is involved:</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="operations-on-strings" class="level2">
<h2>Operations on strings</h2>
<p>If a string looks like a number, Javascript while try to automatically convert it to an number in order to execute a mathematical operation.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb35"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb35-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> message <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;4&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb35-2" data-line-number="2">⠕ message <span class="op">*</span> <span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb35-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="dv">8</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb35-4" data-line-number="4">⠕ message <span class="op">**</span> <span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb35-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="dv">16</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If the automatic type conversion fails in a mathematical operation, Javascript returns the special <em>Not a Number</em> value, <code>NaN</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb36"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb36-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> message <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;Hello, world.&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb36-2" data-line-number="2">⠕ message <span class="op">*</span> <span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb36-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="kw">NaN</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Interestingly, the <code>+</code> operator work with strings, but for strings, the <code>+</code> operator represents <strong>concatenation</strong>, not addition.<br />
As we’ve seen, concatenation means joining the two operands by linking them end-to-end. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb37"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb37-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> fruit <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;banana&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb37-2" data-line-number="2">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> bakedGood <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot; nut bread&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb37-3" data-line-number="3">⠕ <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(fruit <span class="op">+</span> bakedGood)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The output of this program is <code>banana nut bread</code>. The space before the word <code>nut</code> is part of the string, and is necessary to produce the space between the concatenated strings.</p>
<p>Automatic conversion can be tricky and sometimes lead to unexpected results. Consider:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb38-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> age <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;24&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>

</section>
<section id="input" class="level2">
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There is a built-in function in Javascript for getting input from the user:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb39"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb39-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> n <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">window</span>.<span class="at">prompt</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Please enter your name: &quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If you run this sample in a repl.it prompt, it will open a dialog window with the message:</p>
<pre><code>Please enter your name: </code></pre>
<p>The user of the program can type the name and hit <code>enter</code>. When this happens the text that has been entered is returned from the <code>prompt</code> function, and in this case assigned to the variable <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>Even if you asked the user to enter their age, you would get back a string like <code>&quot;17&quot;</code>. It would be your job, as the programmer, to convert that string into a integer or float before using it, if that was required.</p>
</section>
<section id="composition" class="level2">
<h2>Composition</h2>
<p>So far, we have looked at the elements of a program — variables, expressions, statements, and function calls — in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.</p>
<p>One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small building blocks and <strong>compose</strong> them into larger chunks.</p>
<p>For example, we know how to get the user to enter some input, we know how to convert the string we get into a number, we know how to write a complex expression, and we know how to print values. Let’s put these together in a small four-step program that asks the user to input a value for the radius of a circle, and then computes the area of the circle from the formula</p>
<p><img src="figs/circle_area.png" /></p>
<p>Firstly, we’ll do the four steps one at a time:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb41"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb41-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">let</span> response <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">window</span>.<span class="at">prompt</span>(<span class="st">&quot;What is your radius? &quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb41-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">let</span> r <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">Number</span>.<span class="at">parseFloat</span>(response)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb41-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="kw">let</span> area <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">3.14159</span> <span class="op">*</span> r<span class="op">**</span><span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb41-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;The area is &quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> area)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s compose the first two lines into a single line of code, and compose the second two lines into another line of code.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb42"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb42-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">let</span> r <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">Number</span>.<span class="at">parseFloat</span>(<span class="va">window</span>.<span class="at">prompt</span>(<span class="st">&quot;What is your radius? &quot;</span>))<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb42-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;The area is &quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="fl">3.14159</span> <span class="op">*</span> r<span class="op">**</span><span class="dv">2</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If we really wanted to be tricky, we could write it all in one statement:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb43"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb43-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;The area is &quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="fl">3.14159</span> <span class="op">*</span> <span class="va">Number</span>.<span class="at">parseFloat</span>(<span class="va">window</span>.<span class="at">prompt</span>(<span class="st">&quot;What is your radius? &quot;</span>))<span class="op">**</span><span class="dv">2</span>)<span class="op">;</span> </a></code></pre></div>
<p>Such compact code may not be the most understandable for humans, but it does illustrate how we can compose bigger chunks from our building blocks.</p>
<p>If you’re ever in doubt about whether to compose code or fragment it into smaller steps, try to make it as simple as you can for the human to follow. My choice would be the first case above, with four separate steps.</p>

<section id="the-modulus-operator" class="level2">
<h2>The modulus operator</h2>
<p>The <strong>modulus operator</strong> works on integers (and integer expressions) and gives the <em>remainder</em> when the first number is divided by the second. In Javascript, the modulus operator is a percent sign (<code>%</code>). The syntax is the same as for other operators. It has the same precedence as the multiplication operator.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb44"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb44-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> q <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">floor</span>(<span class="dv">7</span> / <span class="dv">3</span>)<span class="op">;</span>     <span class="co">// This is integer division</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb44-2" data-line-number="2">⠕ q<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb44-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="dv">2</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb44-4" data-line-number="4">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> r  <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">7</span> <span class="op">%</span> <span class="dv">3</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb44-5" data-line-number="5">⠕ r<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb44-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="dv">1</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>So 7 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 1.</p>
<p>The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For example, you can check whether one number is divisible by another—if <code>x % y</code> is zero, then <code>x</code> is evenly divisible by <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>Also, you can extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. For example, <code>x % 10</code> yields the right-most digit of <code>x</code> (in base 10). Similarly <code>x % 100</code> yields the last two digits.</p>
<p>It is also extremely useful for doing conversions, say from seconds, to hours, minutes and seconds. So let’s write a program to ask the user to enter some seconds, and we’ll convert them into hours, minutes, and remaining seconds.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb45"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb45-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> totalSecs <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">Number</span>.<span class="at">parseInt</span>(<span class="va">window</span>.<span class="at">prompt</span>(<span class="st">&quot;How many seconds, in total?&quot;</span>))<span class="op">;</span></a>

<h1>Functions</h1>
<section id="functions-1" class="level2">
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>In Javascript, a <strong>function</strong> is a named sequence of statements that belong together. Their primary purpose is to help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think about the problem.</p>
<p>The syntax for a <strong>function definition</strong> is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb46"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb46-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">NAME</span>( PARAMETERS ) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb46-2" data-line-number="2">  STATEMENTS</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb46-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>We can make up any names we want for the functions we create, except that we can’t use a name that is a Javascript keyword, and the names must follow the rules for legal identifiers (the same rules that apply to variable names).</p>
<p>There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be between the curly braces (<code>{}</code>). These statements make up the <strong>function body</strong>. In the examples in this book, we will use the standard indentation of two spaces. Function definitions are the second of several <strong>compound statements</strong> we will see, all of which have the same pattern:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A header line which begins with a keyword and ends with an opening (left) curly brace.</li>
<li>A <strong>body</strong> consisting of one or more Javascript statements, each indented the same amount — <em>we will use 2 spaces</em> — from the header line.</li>
<li>A closing (right) curly brace.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ve already seen the <code>for</code> loop which follows this pattern.</p>
<p>So looking again at the function definition, the keyword in the header is <code>function</code>, which is followed by the name of the function and some <em>parameters</em> enclosed in parentheses. The parameter list may be empty, or it may contain any number of parameters separated from one another by commas. In either case, the parentheses are required. The parameters specifies what information, if any, we have to provide in order to use the new function.</p>
<p>Suppose we are writing a program to calculate the amount of tip due on a bill. We might write a function to “calculate tip”. “calculate tip” is an <em>abstraction</em>, or a mental chunk, of a number of smaller steps. So let’s write a function to capture the pattern of this “building block”:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb47"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb47-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="co">/*</span></a>

<p>This function is named <code>calculateTip</code>. It has two parameters: one to tell the function the amount of the bill, and the other to tell it the percent tip to calculate.</p>
<p>Defining a new function does not make the function run. To do that we need a <strong>function call</strong>. We’ve already seen how to call some built-in functions like <strong>console.log</strong>, <strong>window.input</strong>, and <strong>Number.parseInt</strong>. Function calls contain the name of the function being executed followed by a list of values, called <em>arguments</em>, which are assigned to the parameters in the function definition. So in the last line of the example program above, we call the function, and pass <code>100</code> as the amount of the bill and <code>18</code> as the percentage of the tip. While the function is executing, then, the variable <code>bill</code> refers to the value 100, and the variable <code>pct</code> refers to 18. We can pass either variables (like <code>myBill</code>) or literal values (like <code>100</code>) as arguments.</p>
<p>Once we’ve defined a function, we can call it as often as we like, and its statements will be executed each time we call it. In the next example, we calculate 3 different tip amounts for the same bill, using <code>calculateTip</code> defined above.</p>

<aside id="coding-style">
<p><strong>Coding Style</strong></p>
<p>Now that you are about to write longer, more complex pieces of Javascript, it is a good time to talk about coding style. Most languages can be written (or more concise, formatted) in different styles; some are more readable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that.</p>
<p>For our Javascript, we will follow the coding style described in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Coding_Style">Mozilla project developer’s guide</a>. Here are the most important points extracted for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use 2-space indentation, and no tabs.</li>
<li>Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 80 characters.
<ul>
<li>This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use double quotes <code>&quot;</code> for string literals, except when avoiding inline double quotes</li>
<li>Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.</li>
<li>When possible, put comments on a line of their own.</li>
<li>Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4).</li>
<li>Name your variables, classes, and functions consistently; the convention is to use CamelCase for identifier names.</li>
<li>Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Use UTF-8 or plain ASCII.
<ul>
<li>Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers.</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Composition: Functions can call other functions</h2>
<p>So far, we have looked at the elements of a program—<code>variables</code>, <code>expressions</code>, and <code>statements</code>—in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.</p>
<p>One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small building blocks and <strong>compose</strong> them. In our <code>calculateTip</code> example, we call several Javascript built-in functions: <code>toFixed</code> to keep our amounts to 2 decimal places and <code>Number.parseFloat</code> to convert the data to a float so that we can use <code>toFixed</code>. We use <code>console.log</code> to print our output on the Javascript console. As we will see, we can compose our programs of many functions that we define ourselves.</p>
<p>There are some points worth noting here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions can call other functions.</li>
<li>A caller of this function might say <code>calculateTip(myBill, 15)</code>. The parameters of this function, <code>bill</code> and <code>tip</code>, are assigned the values of the myBill variable, and the number literal 15, respectively.</li>
<li>In the body of the function they are just like any other variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, it may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to create all of these new functions. Actually, there are a lot of reasons, but this example demonstrates two:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Creating a new function gives us an opportunity to name a group of statements. Functions can simplify a program by hiding a complex computation behind a single command. The function (including its name) can capture our mental chunking, or <em>abstraction</em>, of the problem.<br />
</li>
<li>Creating a new function can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we might expect, we have to create a function before we can execute it. In other words, the function definition has to be executed before the function is called.</p>
</section>
<section id="flow-of-execution" class="level2">
<h2>Flow of execution</h2>
<p>In order to ensure that a function is defined before its first use, we have to know the order in which statements are executed, which is called the <strong>flow of execution</strong>.</p>
<p>Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called. In Javascript we can define one function inside another. In this case, the inner definition isn’t executed until the outer function is called.</p>
<p>Function calls are like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the first line of the called function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.</p>
<p>That sounds simple enough, until we remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the statements in another function. But while executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet another function!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Javascript is adept at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it terminates.</p>
<p>What’s the moral of this sordid tale? When we read a program, don’t read from top to bottom. Instead, follow the flow of execution.</p>
</section>
<section id="functions-that-require-arguments" class="level2">
<h2>Functions that require arguments</h2>
<p>Most functions require arguments: the arguments provide for generalization, allowing the same function to work with different data inputs. For example, if we want to find the absolute value of a number, we have to indicate what the number is. The Javascript <code>Math</code> class has a built-in function for computing the absolute value:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb49"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb49-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">abs</span>(<span class="dv">5</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb49-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="dv">5</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb49-3" data-line-number="3">⠕ <span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">abs</span>(<span class="op">-</span><span class="dv">5</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb49-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="dv">5</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>In this example, the arguments to the <code>abs</code> function are 5 and -5.</p>
<p>Some functions take more than one argument. For example the function <code>calculateTip</code> function we wrote in the example above takes two arguments: the amount of the bill and the percent tip to calculate. Inside the function, the values that are passed get assigned to variables called <strong>parameters</strong>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb50"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb50-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="at">calculateTip</span>(<span class="dv">87</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">10</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb50-2" data-line-number="2">Bill amount<span class="op">:</span> $87</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb50-3" data-line-number="3">Tip percentage<span class="op">:</span> <span class="dv">10</span><span class="op">%</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb50-4" data-line-number="4">Total amount due<span class="op">:</span> <span class="va">$8</span>.<span class="dv">70</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Another built-in function that takes more than one argument is <code>Math.max</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb51"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb51-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">max</span>(<span class="dv">7</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">11</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb51-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="dv">17</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb51-5" data-line-number="5">⠕ <span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">max</span>(<span class="dv">3</span> <span class="op">*</span> <span class="dv">11</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">5</span><span class="op">**</span><span class="dv">3</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">512</span> <span class="op">-</span> <span class="dv">9</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">1024</span><span class="op">**</span><span class="dv">0</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb51-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="dv">503</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p><code>Math.max</code> can be passed any number of arguments, separated by commas, and will return the largest value passed. The arguments can be either simple values or expressions. In the last example, 503 is returned, since it is larger than 33, 125, and 1. All of the expressions are resolved — in this case the mathematical operations are calculated — before their values are assigned to the function parameters.</p>
</section>
<section id="functions-that-return-values" class="level2">
<h2>Functions that return values</h2>
<p>Some functions return values. In the previous section we saw that <code>Math.abs</code> and <code>Math.max</code> return values. <code>calculateTip</code> does not return a value; it uses <code>console.log</code> to produce output on the screen for the user. We can use the return values from functions to compose more complex functions.</p>
<p>A function that returns a value is called a <strong>fruitful function</strong> in this book. The opposite of a fruitful function is <strong>void function</strong> — one that is not executed for its resulting value, but is executed because it does something useful. (Languages like Java, C#, C and C++ use the term “void function”, other languages like Pascal call it a <strong>procedure</strong>.) Even though void functions are not executed for their resulting value, Javascript always wants to return something. So if the programmer doesn’t arrange to return a value, Javascript will automatically return the value <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<p>How do we write our own fruitful function? Let’s look at the standard formula for compound interest as an example of a fruitful function:</p>
<p><img src="figs/compoundInterest.png" /></p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>return</strong> statement is followed an expression (<code>a</code> in this case). This expression will be evaluated and returned to the caller as the “fruit” of calling this function.</li>
<li>We prompted the user for the principal amount. The type of <code>toInvest</code> is a string, but we need a number before we can work with it. Javascript can automatically convert it to a number for us when we use it in the calculation. Because it is money, and could have decimal places, we’ve used the <code>Number.parseFloat</code> type converter function to parse the string and return a float.</li>
<li>Notice how we entered the arguments for 8% interest, compounded 12 times per year, for 5 years.</li>
<li>When we run this, if we enter <code>100</code> when prompted for the amount to invest, we get the output<br> <em>At the end of the period you’ll have 148.9845708301606</em><br> This is a bit messy with all these decimal places, but remember that Javascript doesn’t understand that we’re working with money: it just does the calculation to the best of its ability, without rounding. Later we’ll see how to format the string that is printed in such a way that it does get nicely rounded to two decimal places before printing.</li>
<li>The line <code>let toInvest = Number.parseFloat( window.prompt(&quot;How much do you want to invest?&quot;) );</code> also shows yet another example of <em>composition</em> — we can call a function like <code>Number.parseFloat</code>, and its arguments can be the results of other function calls (like <code>window.prompt</code>) that we’ve called along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice something else very important here. The name of the variable we pass as an argument — <code>toInvest</code> — has nothing to do with the name of the parameter — <code>p</code>. It is as if <code>p = toInvest</code> is executed when <code>finalAmt</code> is called. It doesn’t matter what the value was named in the caller, in <code>finalAmt</code> its name is <code>p</code>.</p>
<p>These short variable names are getting quite tricky, so perhaps we’d prefer one of these versions instead:</p>

<p>They all do the same thing. Use your judgment to write code that can be best understood by other humans!<br />
Short variable names are more economical and sometimes make code easier to read: <var>E = mc<sup>2</sup></var> would not be nearly so memorable if Einstein had used longer variable names! If you do prefer short names, make sure you also have some comments to enlighten the reader about what the variables are used for.</p>
<hr />
<p>When we declare a new <strong>local variable</strong> inside a function, it only exists inside the function, and we cannot use it outside. For example, consider again this function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb54"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb54-1" data-line-number="1"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb54-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">finalAmt</span> (p<span class="op">,</span> r<span class="op">,</span> n<span class="op">,</span> t) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb54-3" data-line-number="3">  <span class="kw">let</span> a <span class="op">=</span> p <span class="op">*</span> (<span class="dv">1</span> <span class="op">+</span> r/n) <span class="op">**</span> (n <span class="op">*</span> t)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb54-4" data-line-number="4">  <span class="cf">return</span> a<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb54-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="op">}</span> </a></code></pre></div>
<p>If we try to use <code>a</code>, outside the function, we’ll get an error like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb55"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ a</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-2" data-line-number="2">ReferenceError<span class="op">:</span> a is not defined</a></code></pre></div>
<p>The variable <code>a</code> is local to <code>finalAmt</code>, and is not visible outside the function.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>a</code> only exists while the function is being executed — we call this its <strong>lifetime</strong>. When the execution of the function terminates, the local variables are destroyed.</p>
<p>Parameters are also local, and act like local variables. For example, the lifetimes of <code>p</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>n</code>, <code>t</code> begin when <code>finalAmt</code> is called, and the lifetime ends when the function completes its execution.</p>
<p>So it is not possible for a function to set some local variable to a value, complete its execution, and then when it is called again next time, recover the local variable. Each call of the function creates new local variables, and their lifetimes expire when the function returns to the caller.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Write a void (non-fruitful) function to that prints out a “hello” message. Your function should declare 3 parameters: <code>firstName</code>, <code>lastName</code>, and <code>title</code>. <code>title</code> will be Mr., Ms., Dr., etc. The function should print a message like this one: <code>Hello Dr. Matthew Curinga.</code></p></li>
<li><p>Write a function <code>half(num)</code> which returns the value of <code>num</code> divided by 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a function <code>triple(num)</code> which return <code>num</code> * 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a function <code>areaOfACircle(r)</code> which returns the area of a circle of radius <code>r</code>. For the value of PI, use the constant <code>Math.PI</code><br> (Hint: if you can’t remember how to find the area of a circle, look it up or ask a friend.)</p></li>
<li><p>Write a function <code>hypotenuse(a, b)</code> which calculates the hypotonuse of a right triangle when given the length of sides <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a> <code>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</code>.<br> Note, you will need to be able to calculate square roots to solve this problem. You can use the build in math function <code>Math.sqrt</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>(hard bonus) Write a function called <code>distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)</code> which calculates the distance between the point at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) on a Cartesian Plane. You can find the formula for this at <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/distance-2-points.html" class="uri">http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/distance-2-points.html</a><br> Use the <code>hypotenuse</code> function from exercise 5 to compose this function.</p></li>

<section id="functions-lab" class="level2">
<h2>Functions Lab</h2>
<p>This is the first “lab” in our textbook. For this project, you will be asked to write a complete program that solves a problem. The labs should break up parts of the program into different functions. Your program should start when the <code>main()</code> function is called. <code>main</code> is not a keyword in Javascript, but in many programming languages there is a convention that the starting function is called <code>main</code>. Please take a look at the Tip Calculator case study below for a sense of how your program should be structured.</p>
<p>For this first lab, too, please pay attention to your <a href="#coding-style">coding style</a> to make sure that the program is well formatted and easy for human readers to understand.</p>
<p>For this lab you are going to revisit the lemonade stand estimator from the exercises in chapter 2. You will make an interactive program that asks the user to enter all of the data for:</p>
<ul>
<li>prices of the ingredients</li>
<li>prices for the materials (e.g. cups)</li>
<li>sale price for a cup of lemonade</li>
<li>and estimation of the number of cups sold</li>
</ul>
<p>Once all of the data is entered, the program will print out a neatly formatted message with the results of the estimation.</p>

<h2>Code Listing 1: The Tip Calculator</h2>
<section id="refactoring" class="level3">
<h3>Refactoring</h3>
<p>Now that we have fruitful functions, we can focus our attention on reorganizing our code so that it fits more nicely into our mental chunks.<br />
This process of rearrangement is called <strong>refactoring</strong> the code.</p>
<p>With our Tip Calculator we need to find the amount of the tip and show the results to the user. In the example below, we separate the various functions of the program to make a more complete tip calculator. As you’ll see, we’re starting to build code that is useful. Using functions allows us to make changes to one part of a program without affecting other parts of the program. For example, we can change the welcome message without worrying about breaking our calculations.</p>
<p>The trick about refactoring code is to anticipate which things we are likely to want to change each time we call the function: these should become the parameters, or changeable parts, of the functions we write.</p>

<h3>Case Study: Tip Calculator</h3>
<aside data-line-number="1">
<p>Brief header <strong>comments</strong> at the top of the <strong>source file</strong> identify basic information about the program and the file. Comments are messages for programmers who read the <strong>source code</strong> — they do not affect the execution of the program.</p>
</aside>
<aside data-line-number="14">
<p><code>welcome</code> is a very simple <strong>function</strong> — it does not accept any data in the form of <strong>function parameters</strong> and it does not <strong>return</strong> any data using a <strong>return statement</strong>. It simply prints out a message to the console.</p>
</aside>
<aside data-line-number="30">
<p>The <code>calcTip</code> function defines 2 <strong>parameters</strong>: <code>bill</code> and <code>pct</code>. These parameters become variables within the <strong>function body</strong>. Line 30 uses <strong>arithmetic operators</strong> (multiplication here) to calculate a new value and store it in the <code>tip</code> <strong>variable</strong>. <code>tip</code> is converted to a float using the <strong>built-in function</strong> <code>Number.parseFloat</code>. Finally, the rounded tip amount is returned.</p>
</aside>
<aside data-line-number="43">
<p><code>askBillAmt</code> is a <strong>fruitful function</strong> because it has a <strong>return statement</strong>. It uses the <strong>built-in function</strong> <code>window.prompt</code> to ask for data from the user of the program. When this function is called, it returns the amount of the bill as a float, because it represents money.</p>
</aside>
<aside data-line-number="61">
<p><code>money</code> is a small helper function that we wrote to re-use the task of formatting numbers as currency with a dollar sign and two decimal places. It is called 3 times in <code>showResults</code> with different <strong>arguments</strong>.</p>
</aside>
<aside data-line-number="70">
<p><code>showResults</code> defines 3 <strong>parameters</strong> which are used to pass in all of the data needed to show the results of the tip calculation. Notice that the <code>console.log</code> statements use the <strong>+ operator</strong> to <abbr title="join together">concatenate</abbr> strings. Because we are joining <strong>string literals</strong> with variables of type <code>number</code>. The <code>+</code> operator automatically converts the numbers to strings.</p>
</aside>
<aside data-line-number="90">
<p><code>main</code> is the first function <strong>called</strong> for this program. It maintains the executive control of the program, calling other functions in sequence and passing data between functions. All of the other functions have been defined, but are waiting to be called.</p>

<h2>Boolean values and expressions</h2>
<p>A <em>Boolean</em> value is either true or false. It is named after the British mathematician, George Boole, who first formulated <em>Boolean algebra</em> — some rules for reasoning about and combining these values. This is the basis of all modern computer logic.</p>
<p>In Javascript, the two Boolean values are <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> (the capitalization must be exactly as shown), and the Javascript type is <strong>‘boolean’</strong>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb58"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ tyepof <span class="kw">true</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="st">&#39;boolean&#39;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb58-3" data-line-number="3">⠕ tyepof True<span class="op">;</span></a>

<p>A <strong>Boolean expression</strong> is an expression that evaluates to produce a result which is a Boolean value. For example, the operator <code>===</code> tests if two values are equal. It produces (or <em>yields</em>) a Boolean value:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb59"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="dv">5</span> <span class="op">===</span> (<span class="dv">3</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="dv">2</span>)<span class="op">;</span>   <span class="co">// Is five equal 5 to the result of 3 + 2? </span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="kw">true</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-3" data-line-number="3">⠕ <span class="dv">5</span> <span class="op">===</span> <span class="dv">6</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="kw">false</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-5" data-line-number="5">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> j <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;hel&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-6" data-line-number="6">⠕ j <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot;lo&quot;</span> <span class="op">===</span> <span class="st">&quot;hello&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb59-7" data-line-number="7"><span class="kw">true</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>In the first statement, the two operands evaluate to equal values, so the expression evaluates to <code>true</code>; in the second statement, 5 is not equal to 6, so we get <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>===</code> operator is one of six common <strong>comparison operators</strong> which all produce a <code>boolean</code> result; here are all six:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb60"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-1" data-line-number="1">x <span class="op">===</span> y   <span class="co">// Produce true if x is equal to y</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-2" data-line-number="2">x <span class="op">!==</span> y   <span class="co">// Produce true if x is not equal to y</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-3" data-line-number="3">x <span class="op">&gt;</span> y     <span class="co">// Produce true if x is greater than y</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-4" data-line-number="4">x <span class="op">&lt;</span> y     <span class="co">// Produce true if x is less than y</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-5" data-line-number="5">x <span class="op">&gt;=</span> y    <span class="co">// Produce true if x is greater than or equal to y</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-6" data-line-number="6">x <span class="op">&lt;=</span> y    <span class="co">// Produce true if x is less than or equal to y</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Although these operations are probably familiar, the Javascript symbols are different from the mathematical symbols. A common error is to use a single equal sign (<code>=</code>) instead of a triple equal sign (<code>===</code>). Remember that <code>=</code> is an assignment operator and <code>===</code> is a comparison operator. Also, there is no such thing as <code>=&lt;</code> or <code>=&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Like any other types we’ve seen so far, Boolean values can be assigned to variables, printed, etc.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb61"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb61-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="kw">let</span> age <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">18</span><span class="op">;</span></a>

<aside id="strict-equality">
<p><strong>Equality and “sameness” in Javascript</strong></p>
<p>Javascript, as a programming language, is a little bit quirky when it comes to testing equality. The double equal sign <code>==</code> is a “loose” equality operator, while the triple equal sign <code>===</code> used in the examples above is the “strict” equality operator.</p>
<p>When we looked at variables and data types in chapter 2, we saw how Javascript does automatic type conversion. For example, it converts numbers to strings when you use the <code>+</code> token for string concatenation and strings to numbers (if it can) when we use other mathematical operators.</p>
<p>The <code>==</code> compares values for equality <em>after</em> type conversion, whereas the <code>===</code> compares values <em>before</em> conversion. Only values of the same type are equal with the strict operator.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb62"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-1" data-line-number="1">⠕ <span class="dv">5</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">&quot;5&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// true because of type conversion</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="op">=&gt;</span> <span class="kw">true</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>In addition to the loose equality with <code>==</code> there is a loose inequality operator using <code>!=</code>. Because loose equality (and inequality) is difficult to predict, <strong>we will only use strict equality</strong> in the examples in this book. However, you are likely to encounter both styles when reading other code, documentation, and tutorials.</p>
<p>For further reading on this topic you can read <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness">Equality comparison and sameness</a> on the Mozilla Developer Network.</p>

<section id="logical-operators" class="level2">
<h2>Logical operators</h2>
<p>There are three <strong>logical operators</strong>, <em>and</em> <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <em>or</em> <code>||</code>, and <em>not</em> <code>!</code>, that allow us to build more complex Boolean expressions from simpler Boolean expressions. The semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example, <code>x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 10</code> produces <code>true</code> only if <code>x</code> is greater than 0 <em>and</em> at the same time, x is less than 10.</p>
<p><code>n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0</code> is <code>true</code> if <em>either</em> of the conditions are <code>true</code>, that is, if the number <code>n</code> is divisible by 2 <em>or</em> it is divisible by 3. (What do you think happens if <code>n</code> is divisible by both 2 and by 3 at the same time? Will the expression yield <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>? Try it in your Javascript interpreter.)</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>not</code> operator negates a Boolean value, so <code>! (x &gt; y)</code> is <code>true</code> if <code>(x &gt; y)</code> is <code>false</code>, that is, if <code>x</code> is less than or equal to <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>The expression on the left of the <code>||</code> operator is evaluated first: if the result is <code>true</code>, Javascript does not (and need not) evaluate the expression on the right — this is called <em>short-circuit evaluation</em>. Similarly, for the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator, if the expression on the left yields <code>false</code>, Javascript does not evaluate the expression on the right.</p>
<p>So there are no unnecessary evaluations.</p>
</section>
<section id="truth-tables" class="level2">
<h2>Truth Tables</h2>
<p>A truth table is a small table that allows us to list all the possible inputs, and to give the results for the logical operators. Because the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> operators each have two operands, there are only four rows in a truth table that describes the semantics of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">a</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">b</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">a &amp;&amp; b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">False</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">False</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">False</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">False</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">True</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">False</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">True</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">False</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">False</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">True</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">True</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">True</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In a Truth Table, we sometimes use T and F as shorthand for the two Boolean values: here is the truth table describing <code>||</code>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">a</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">b</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">a || b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">F</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">F</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">F</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">F</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">T</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">T</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">T</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">F</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">T</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">T</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">T</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">T</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The third logical operator, <code>!</code>, only takes a single operand, so its truth table only has two rows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">a</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">!a</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">F</td>

<section id="simplifying-boolean-expressions" class="level2">
<h2>Simplifying Boolean Expressions</h2>
<p>A set of rules for simplifying and rearranging expressions is called an <em>algebra</em>. For example, we are all familiar with school algebra rules, such as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb63"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb63-1" data-line-number="1">n <span class="op">*</span> <span class="dv">0</span> <span class="op">===</span> <span class="dv">0</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>which provides rules for working with Boolean values.</p>
<p>First, the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb64"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-1" data-line-number="1">x <span class="op">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="kw">false</span> <span class="op">===</span> <span class="kw">false</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">false</span> <span class="op">&amp;&amp;</span> x <span class="op">===</span> <span class="kw">false</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-3" data-line-number="3">y <span class="op">&amp;&amp;</span> x <span class="op">===</span> x <span class="op">&amp;&amp;</span> y</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-4" data-line-number="4">x <span class="op">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="kw">true</span> <span class="op">===</span> x</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="kw">true</span> <span class="op">&amp;&amp;</span> x <span class="op">===</span> x</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-6" data-line-number="6">x <span class="op">&amp;&amp;</span> x <span class="op">===</span> x</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Here are some corresponding rules for the <code>||</code> operator:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb65"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb65-1" data-line-number="1">x <span class="op">||</span> <span class="kw">false</span> <span class="op">===</span> x</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb65-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">false</span> <span class="op">||</span> x <span class="op">===</span> x</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb65-3" data-line-number="3">y <span class="op">||</span> x <span class="op">===</span> x <span class="op">||</span> y</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb65-4" data-line-number="4">x <span class="op">||</span> <span class="kw">true</span> <span class="op">===</span> <span class="kw">true</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb65-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="kw">true</span> <span class="op">||</span> x <span class="op">===</span> <span class="kw">true</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb65-6" data-line-number="6">x <span class="op">||</span> x <span class="op">===</span> x</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Two <code>!</code> operators cancel each other:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb66"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb66-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="op">!</span>(<span class="op">!</span>x) <span class="op">===</span> x</a></code></pre></div>
</section>
<section id="conditional-execution" class="level2">
<h2>Conditional execution</h2>
<p>In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. <strong>Conditional statements</strong> give us this ability. The simplest form is the <strong>if</strong> statement:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb67"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb67-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (x <span class="op">%</span> <span class="dv">2</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb67-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(x<span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot; is even.&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb67-3" data-line-number="3">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Did you know that 2 is the only even number that is prime?&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb67-7" data-line-number="7">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Did you know that multiplying two odd numbers always gives an odd result?&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb67-8" data-line-number="8"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If it is true, then all the indented statements get executed. If not, then all the statements indented under the <code>else</code> clause get executed.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/flowchart_if_else.png" alt="Flowchart of an if statement with an else clause" /><figcaption>Flowchart of an if statement with an else clause</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The syntax for an <code>if</code> statement looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb68"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb68-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> BOOLEAN EXPRESSION <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb68-2" data-line-number="2">  STATEMENTS_1   <span class="co">// Executed if condition evaluates to true</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb68-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb68-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="cf">else</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb68-5" data-line-number="5">  STATEMENTS_2   <span class="co">// Executed if condition evaluates to false</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb68-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>As with the function definition from the last chapter and other compound statements like <code>for</code>, the <code>if</code> statement consists of a header line and a body. The header line begins with the keyword <code>if</code> followed by a <em>Boolean expression</em> and ends with a left curly brace ( { ).</p>
<p>The indented statements that follow are called a <strong>block</strong>. The block ends with the right curly brace ( } ).</p>
<p>Each of the statements inside the first block of statements are executed in order if the Boolean expression evaluates to <code>true</code>. The entire first block of statements is skipped if the Boolean expression evaluates to <code>false</code>, and instead all the statements indented under the <code>else</code> clause are executed.</p>
<p>There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear under the two clauses of an <code>if</code> statement, but there has to be at least one statement in each block.</p>
</section>
<section id="omitting-the-else-clause" class="level2">
<h2>Omitting the <code>else</code> clause</h2>
<figure>
<img src="figs/flowchart_if_only.png" alt="Flowchart of an if statement with no else clause" /><figcaption>Flowchart of an if statement with no else clause</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another form of the <code>if</code> statement is one in which the <code>else</code> clause is omitted entirely. In this case, when the condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, the statements are executed, otherwise the flow of execution continues to the statement after the <code>if</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb69"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb69-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (x <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb69-3" data-line-number="3">  x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">42</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb69-4" data-line-number="4">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;I&#39;ve decided to use the number 42 instead.&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb69-6" data-line-number="6"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb69-7" data-line-number="7"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;The square root of &quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> x<span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;is&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">sqrt</span>(x)) <span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case, the print function that outputs the square root is the one after the <code>if</code> — it comes after our curly braces ended the conditional block.</p>
<p>Notice that <code>else</code> is not a statement. The <code>if</code> statement has two <em>clauses</em>, one of which is the (optional) <code>else</code> clause. However you can never use the <code>else</code> keyword outside of an <code>if</code> statement.</p>
</section>
<section id="chained-conditionals" class="level2">
<h2>Chained conditionals</h2>
<p>Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches. One way to express a computation like that is a <strong>chained conditional</strong>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb70"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb70-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (x <span class="op">&lt;</span> y) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb70-2" data-line-number="2">  STATEMENTS_A</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb70-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb70-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="cf">else</span> <span class="cf">if</span> (x <span class="op">&gt;</span> y) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb70-5" data-line-number="5">  STATEMENTS_B</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb70-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb70-7" data-line-number="7"><span class="cf">else</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb70-8" data-line-number="8">  STATEMENTS_C</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb70-9" data-line-number="9"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>

<p>Again, exactly one branch will be executed. There is no limit of the number of <code>else if</code> statements but only a single (and optional) final <code>else</code> statement is allowed and it must be the last branch in the statement:</p>

<p>Each condition is checked in order. If the first is false, the next is checked, and so on. If one of them is true, the corresponding branch executes, and the statement ends. Even if more than one condition is true, only the first true branch executes.</p>
</section>
<section id="nested-conditionals" class="level2">
<h2>Nested conditionals</h2>
<p>One conditional can also be <strong>nested</strong> within another. (It is the same theme of composability, again!) We could have written the previous example as follows:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/flowchart_nested_conditional.png" alt="Flowchart of this nested conditional" /><figcaption>Flowchart of this nested conditional</figcaption>

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb72"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb72-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (x <span class="op">&lt;</span> y) <span class="op">{</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb72-10" data-line-number="10">  <span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb72-11" data-line-number="11"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The outer conditional contains two branches. The second branch contains another <code>if</code> statement, which has two branches of its own. Those two branches could contain conditional statements as well.</p>
<p>Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent, nested conditionals very quickly become difficult to read. In general, it is a good idea to avoid them when we can.</p>
<p>Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional statements. For example, we can rewrite the following code using a single conditional:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb73"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb73-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="dv">0</span> <span class="op">&lt;</span> x) <span class="op">{</span>    <span class="co">// Assume x is a number here</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb73-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="cf">if</span> (x <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">10</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb73-3" data-line-number="3">    <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;x is a positive single digit.&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb73-4" data-line-number="4">  <span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb73-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>console.log</code> function is called only if we make it past both the conditionals, so instead of the above which uses two <code>if</code> statements each with a simple condition, we could make a more complex condition using the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator. Now we only need a single <code>if</code> statement:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb74"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb74-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="dv">0</span> <span class="op">&lt;</span> x <span class="op">&amp;&amp;</span> x <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">10</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb74-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;x is a positive single digit.&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb74-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
</section>
<section id="the-return-statement" class="level2">
<h2>The <code>return</code> statement</h2>
<p>The <code>return</code> statement, with or without a value, depending on whether the function is fruitful or void, allows us to terminate the execution of a function before (or when) we reach the end. One reason to use an <em>early return</em> is if we detect an error condition:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb75"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">printSquareRoot</span>(x) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="cf">if</span> (x <span class="op">&lt;=</span> <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-3" data-line-number="3">    <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Positive numbers only, please.&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-4" data-line-number="4">    <span class="cf">return</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-5" data-line-number="5">  <span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-6" data-line-number="6">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;The square root of&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> x<span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;is&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> result)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-7" data-line-number="7"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The function <code>printSquareRoot</code> has a parameter named <code>x</code>. The first thing it does is check whether <code>x</code> is less than or equal to 0, in which case it displays an error message and then uses <code>return</code> to exit the function. The flow of execution immediately returns to the caller, and the remaining lines of the function are not executed.</p>
</section>
<section id="truthy-evaluations" class="level2">
<h2>Truthy evaluations</h2>
<p>As you integrate Boolean logic into your programs, you will often encounter the pattern where you test if a single value evaluates to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. The Boolean condition can be written without a comparison operator because the value itself will be resolves to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb76"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb76-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (email) <span class="op">{</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb76-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Any value that is not <code>false</code>, <code>undefined</code>, <code>null</code>, 0, <code>NaN</code>, or an empty string (’’) actually <strong>returns true</strong> when tested as a conditional statement. Consider the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb77"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb77-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">let</span> first <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;Diego&quot;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb77-19" data-line-number="19"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above example we can say that <code>email</code> is <em>truthy</em> because it evaluates to <code>true</code> even though it doesn’t equal <code>true</code>. Likewise, <code>last</code> is <em>falsy</em> — it evaluates to <code>false</code> because it’s an empty string, not equal to <code>false</code>.</p>
<aside id="curly-braces">
<p><strong>Optional curly braces</strong></p>
<p>Curly braces in Javascript are optional of the block only has one statement. This is the case for all blocks — following the <code>function</code> header, <code>for</code> header, <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>, and others we haven’t seen yet. While it is uncommon for other types of blocks, it is not uncommon to see <code>if</code> statements without curly braces. You may see:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb78"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb78-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="op">!</span>oldEnoughToDrive)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb78-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;You can&#39;t rent a car.&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This is identical to</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb79"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb79-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="op">!</span>oldEnoughToDrive) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb79-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;You can&#39;t rent a car.&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb79-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Some programmers consider it bad practice to omit curly braces for single statements, because it reduces readability and can lead to bugs. We recommend always using curly braces for blocks and our examples in this book follow this style.</p>

<section id="logical-opposites" class="level2">
<h2>Logical opposites</h2>
<p>Each of the six relational operators has a logical opposite: for example, suppose we can get a driving license when our age is greater or equal to 16, we can <em>not</em> get the driving license when we are less than 16.</p>
<p>Notice that the opposite of <code>&gt;=</code> is <code>&lt;</code>.</p>
<table>

<tr class="odd">

<tr class="even">

<td>&lt;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Understanding these logical opposites allows us to sometimes get rid of <code>!</code> operators. <code>!</code> operators are often quite difficult to read in computer code, and our intentions will usually be clearer if we can eliminate them.</p>
<p>For example, if we wrote this Javascript:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb80"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb80-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="op">!</span>(age <span class="op">&gt;=</span> <span class="dv">16</span>)) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb80-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hey, you&#39;re too young to get a driving license!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb80-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb80-4" data-line-number="4">  </a></code></pre></div>
<p>it would probably be clearer to use the simplification laws, and to write instead:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb81"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb81-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (age <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">16</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb81-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hey, you&#39;re too young to get a driving license!&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb81-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Two powerful simplification laws (called de Morgan’s laws) that are often helpful when dealing with complicated Boolean expressions are:</p>
<pre><code>!(x &amp;&amp; y)  ===  (!x) || (!y) 
!(x || y)   ===  (!x) &amp;&amp; (!y)</code></pre>
<p>For example, suppose we can slay the dragon only if our magic lightsabre sword is charged to 90% or higher, and we have 100 or more energy units in our protective shield. We find this fragment of Javascript code in the game:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb83"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb83-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> <span class="op">!</span>((swordCharge <span class="op">&gt;=</span> <span class="fl">0.90</span>) <span class="op">&amp;&amp;</span> (shieldEnergy <span class="op">&gt;=</span> <span class="dv">100</span>)) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb83-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Your attack has no effect, the dragon fries you to a crisp!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb83-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb83-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="cf">else</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb83-5" data-line-number="5">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;The dragon crumples in a heap. You rescue the gorgeous prince!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb83-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>de Morgan’s laws together with the logical opposites would let us rework the condition in a (perhaps) easier to understand way like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb84"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb84-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (swordCharge <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="fl">0.90</span>) <span class="op">||</span> (shieldEnergy <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">100</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb84-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Your attack has no effect, the dragon fries you to a crisp!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb84-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb84-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="cf">else</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb84-5" data-line-number="5">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;The dragon crumples in a heap. You rescue the gorgeous prince!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb84-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>We could also get rid of the <code>!</code> by swapping around the <code>then</code> and <code>else</code> parts of the conditional. So here is a third version, also equivalent:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb85"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb85-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (swordCharge <span class="op">&gt;=</span> <span class="fl">0.90</span>) <span class="at">and</span> (shieldEnergy <span class="op">&gt;=</span> <span class="dv">100</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb85-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;The dragon crumples in a heap. You rescue the gorgeous prince!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb85-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb85-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="cf">else</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb85-5" data-line-number="5">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Your attack has no effect, the dragon fries you to a crisp!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb85-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This last version is probably the best of the three, because it very closely matches<br />
the initial English statement. Clarity of our code (for other humans), and making it easy to see that the code does what we expect should always be a high priority.</p>
<p>As our programming skills develop we’ll find we have more than one way to solve any problem. So good programs are <em>designed</em>. We make choices that favor clarity, simplicity, and elegance. The job title <em>software architect</em> says a lot about what we do — we are <em>architects</em> who engineer our products to balance beauty, functionality, simplicity and clarity in our creations.</p>
<aside id="polish-code-tip">
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Once our program works, we should play around a bit trying to polish it up. Write good comments. Think about whether the code would be clearer with different variable names. Could we have done it more elegantly? Should we rather use a function? Can we simplify the conditionals?</p>
We think of our code as our creation, our work of art! We make it great.

<li><p>(hard bonus) Write a function <code>isRightAngled</code> which, given the length of three sides of a triangle, will determine whether the triangle is right-angled. Assume that the third argument to the function is always the longest side. It will return <code>true</code> if the triangle is right-angled, or <code>false</code> otherwise.<br> Hint: Floating point arithmetic is not always exactly accurate, so it is not safe to test floating point numbers for equality. If a good programmer wants to know whether <code>x</code> is equal or close enough to <code>y</code>, they would probably code it up as:<br></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb86"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb86-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">abs</span>(x<span class="op">-</span>y) <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="fl">0.000001</span>) <span class="op">{</span></a>

<p>If you’re intrigued by why floating point arithmetic is sometimes inaccurate, on a piece of paper, divide 10 by 3 and write down the decimal result. You’ll find it does not terminate, so you’ll need an infinitely long sheet of paper. The <em>representation</em> of numbers in computer memory or on your calculator has similar problems: memory is finite, and some digits may have to be discarded, so small inaccuracies creep in. Try this script:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb87"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource javascript numberLines"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb87-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">let</span> a <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">Math</span>.<span class="at">sqrt</span>(<span class="fl">2.0</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>

<h2>GNU Free Documentation License</h2>
<p>Version 1.3, 3 November 2008</p>
<p>Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="https://fsf.org/" class="uri">https://fsf.org/</a></p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<section id="preamble" class="level4">
<h4>0. PREAMBLE</h4>
<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.</p>
<p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p>
</section>
<section id="applicability-and-definitions" class="level4">
<h4>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</h4>
<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.</p>
<p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</p>
<p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</p>
<p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.</p>
<p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</p>
<p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.</p>
<p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p>
<p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.</p>
<p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.</p>
</section>
<section id="verbatim-copying" class="level4">
<h4>2. VERBATIM COPYING</h4>
<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.</p>
</section>
<section id="copying-in-quantity" class="level4">
<h4>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</h4>
<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p>
</section>
<section id="modifications" class="level4">
<h4>4. MODIFICATIONS</h4>
<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.</li>
<li>B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.</li>
<li>C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.</li>
<li>D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</li>
<li>E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.</li>
<li>F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</li>
<li>G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.</li>
<li>H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.</li>
<li>I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.</li>
<li>J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the “History” section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</li>
<li>K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.</li>
<li>L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</li>
<li>M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.</li>
<li>N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</li>
<li>O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p>
</section>
<section id="combining-documents" class="level4">
<h4>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</h4>
<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History” in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”. You must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements”.</p>
</section>
<section id="collections-of-documents" class="level4">
<h4>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</h4>
<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</p>
</section>
<section id="aggregation-with-independent-works" class="level4">
<h4>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</h4>
<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.</p>
</section>
<section id="translation" class="level4">
<h4>8. TRANSLATION</h4>
<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.</p>
</section>
<section id="termination" class="level4">
<h4>9. TERMINATION</h4>
<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-revisions-of-this-license" class="level4">
<h4>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</h4>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/" class="uri">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.</p>
</section>
<section id="relicensing" class="level4">
<h4>11. RELICENSING</h4>
<p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.</p>
<p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.</p>
<p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.</p>
<p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.</p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.</p>

<section id="addendum-how-to-use-this-license-for-your-documents" class="level3">
<h3>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>
<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:</p>
<pre><code>    Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU
    Free Documentation License&quot;.</code></pre>
<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the “with … Texts.” line with this:</p>
<pre><code>    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</code></pre>
<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.</p>
